# Fibonacci Series

To generate a Fibonacci series of X numbers run the command `npm start X`, for example `npm start 5` will generate the first 5 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Script Acceptance Critera

- The script should generate the first X numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (where X is a number passed to the script) and log each number to the console one line at a time
- The Fibonacci should start at 1 and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers (or 0 if there is no previous). For example:
  - The first number is 1
  - The second number is 1 + 0 = 1
  - The third number is 1 + 1 = 2
  - The fouth number is 2 + 1 = 3
  - The fifth number is 3 + 2 = 5
  - and so on...
- A series of numbers printed by the script would like like:

```
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

## System Requirements

- You will need `Node` & `npm` installed locally in order to run the script.

## Your Task

- We'd like you to add a Unit Testing framework of your choice and add some unit tests to validate the script meets the requirements above.
- The implementation is a naive approach and has some bugs, feel free to add failing tests for any edge cases or bad inputs you like
- You are not expected to spend long on this task, 1 hour should suffice



## Assignment

To run the unit tests `npm install` and `npm run test`
